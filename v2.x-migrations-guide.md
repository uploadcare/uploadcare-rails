## Configuration

The configuration file was moved to the `config/initializers` directory in the version 2.x. So, if you have `yml` file with options, please, run the config generator. It will create a new file `config/initializers/uploadcare.rb`:

```console
# with docker
$ docker-compose exec <web server service name> bundle exec rails g uploadcare_config

# without docker
$ bundle exec rails g uploadcare_config
```
and set there all your config options.

## File Uploader widget settings

To start using the File Uploader widget you should add the `uploadcare_widget_tag` to the <head> tag of the html-page.
In version 1.x this helper tag was called `include_uploadcare_widget_from_cdn`.

```erb
# before
<%= include_uploadcare_widget_from_cdn version: "3.x", min: true %>

# after
<%= uploadcare_widget_tag version: "3.x", min: true %>
```

The helper `uploadcare_settings` is not needed anymore, all the global options for the widget is now taken from the `config/initializers/uploadcare.rb` included in the `uploadcare_widget_tag` tag, so remove it from your views.

The helper `uploadcare_uploader_field` was not changed.
You can use the helper either for `File` and for `Group` attributes of a model. Helper will automatically enable the `multiple` option if you placed the `mount_uploadcare_file_group` method in a model for that attribute.

No difference between single Uploadcare::File and Uploadcare::Group attributes for views:

```erb
  <%= uploadcare_uploader_field :post, :logo %>
  <%= uploadcare_uploader_field :post, :attachments %>
```

### Form builders support

Form builders support was removed from the version 2.x.
So, if you have some of the following helpers used in your views:

```erb
f.uploadcare_uploader :file
f.uploadcare_uploader :file, :data => {:multiple => true}
f.uploadcare_single_uploader_field :file
f.uploadcare_multiple_uploader_field :file
```

please, change it to:

```erb
uploadcare_uploader_field :model_name, :attribute_name
```

## File and Group objects

In the version 2.x `mount_uploadcare_file :attribute_name` and `mount_uploadcare_file_group :attribute_name` are added. Please, change old methods in your models if needed:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  # before
  has_uploadcare_file :logo
  has_uploadcare_group :attachments

  # after
  mount_uploadcare_file :logo
  mount_uploadcare_file_group :attachments
end
```

### File methods

Some methods were changed/removed for File and Group objects.

The method `post.logo` will return `Uploadcare::Rails::File`, not just an URL.
So if you need to get an URL, please, make following changes:

```ruby
# before
post.logo

# after
post.logo.cdn_url
# OR
post.logo.to_s
```

The method `image_tag(post.logo)` was removed in the version 2.x. So if you have to render images this way, please, make following changes:

```erb
# before
<%= image_tag(post.logo) %>

# after
<%= image_tag post.logo.cdn_url %>
OR
<%= image_tag post.logo.to_s %>
```

This all works same way for groups attribute (`post.attachments` in `Post` model example).

### Group methods

Showing group files was not changed much (`urls -> file_urls`):

```erb
# before
<ul>
  <%- @post.attachments.urls.each do |url|%>
    <li>
      <%= image_tag(url) %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

# after
<ul>
  <%- @post.attachments.file_urls.each do |url|%>
    <li>
      <%= image_tag(url) %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

### Image URL transformations

In the version 2.x image URL transformation methods names were changed.

```erb
# before
@post.logo.url(options)
@post.attachments.urls(options)

# after
@post.logo.transform_url(options)
@post.attachments.transform_file_urls(options)
```

Please, see the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for more information about added/removed methods and features.
