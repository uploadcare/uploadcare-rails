  # Defines the file uploader manual crop behavior (see https://uploadcare.com/docs/uploads/file-uploader/#crop-option).

  # This option does not force your file uploader to accept images only.
  # The option also works in the multi-file mode since version 2.3.0.

  # Saves traffic and storage space by resizing images on a client before uploading.
  # See the detailed option description for details. Using the client-side resize does not force the images only option.

  # Allows user to remove uploaded files from the file uploader.
  # Please note that those files are not deleted from your account.
  # config.clearable = true

  # Allows you to define which upload sources you want to use with the file uploader.

  # config.tabs = 'url file facebook'

  # Sets the accept attribute for the file uploader dialog.
  # If the images only option is disabled, the value is empty.
  # Otherwise, the default value is image/*.
  # null means accept should be kept empty regardless of the images only value.
  # For other possible values, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-accept
  # Note, this is not a replacement for
  # our file validation (see https://uploadcare.com/docs/file-uploader-api/file-validation/)
  # because your users will still be able to choose any file via drag&drop or from URL.
  # config.input_access_types = 'image/*'

  # Defines the list of preferred MIME types.
  # The list should be ordered and contain space-separated MIME types.
  # Common parts can be marked with asterisks: image/* application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.*.
  # If no MIME types match the criteria or preferred types aren’t set, default formats are used.
  # Keep in mind that some cloud services can export data in different formats.
  # For example, Google document can be exported as Word document, PDF or plain text.
  # config.preferred_types = 'image/* application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.*'

  # Forces a system-native file picking dialog to show up instead of our file uploader.
  # That makes the file uploader behavior as close as possible to the generic <input type="file">.
  # Native behavior is achieved at the expense of support for uploading content
  # from social media and cloud storage, manual crop, and preview step.
  # Multi-file selection would still work.
  # The option does not work in old browser versions: the dialog falls back to the file uploader.
  # config.system_dialog = false

  # This option sets the file size threshold for multipart uploading.
  # The value ranges from 10485760 (10 MB), which is default, up to 104857600 (100 MB).
  # If a file size hits the threshold, it gets uploaded in four parallel chunks by 5 MB.
  # Multipart upload makes large file uploading faster.
  # Files go directly to a storage, bypassing our upload servers,
  # and they're quickly available for further use. All files below the threshold get uploaded in one piece.
  # Note: Multipart upload works with local sources only (files and camera).
